## About project
This is my CS50x final project. I often forget to do simple errands or to do something.
The very simple goal of a to-do list is to get my tasks done; often it is a simple activity like putting your sheets back on the bed or booking my next trip. Often a list is all that is necessary to meet that simple goal.
The best way to manage a list is simply to put everything on the list as a priority to do. If it is something you had to do, and it took me a minute to get that done, it should be marked as a basic task; in this way, everything is a priority.
<br/>
<br/>

DONE is a web application that works as a To-Do list.
<br/>
The functionalities of the application are:

- Registration: Mandatory, functionalities of the application are available only if the user is registered.
- Password change: After registering, users can alter their password only if the current password is provided.
- Add: Append the new item to the ToDo list.
- Edit: After adding an item to the list, the user can edit it.
- Done: Removes the item from the list.

    - [Flask Dependencies Automatically Installed with Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#dependencies)
        * [Werkzeug](https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/) implements WSGI, the standard Python interface between applications and servers.
        * [Jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) is a template language that renders the pages your application serves.
        * [MarkupSafe](https://palletsprojects.com/p/markupsafe/) comes with Jinja. It escapes untrusted input when rendering templates to avoid injection attacks.
        * [ItsDangerous](https://palletsprojects.com/p/itsdangerous/) securely signs data to ensure its integrity. This is used to protect Flaskâ€™s session cookie.
        * [Click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) is a framework for writing command line applications. It provides the flask command and allows adding custom management commands.

    - [Optional Dependencies](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#optional-dependencies)
        * [Blinker](https://pythonhosted.org/blinker/) provides support for [Signals](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/signals/).
        * [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#readme) enables support for Environment Variables From dotenv when running flask commands.
        * [Watchdog](https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/) provides a faster, more efficient reloader for the development server.

## Cloning

Copy and paste `git --version` to your terminal to check if you have Git installed on your system.
<br/>
If your terminal returns a Git version as an output, that confirms you have Git installed on your system and you can skip the first step below.
<br/>
If not, you have to download and install Git.

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
# Downloads and installs Git

$ git clone https://github.com/g-k-coder/project-50.git
# Clones the GitHub repository to your machine
```
<br/>

## Coding style test

Check if the code is aesthetically pleasing and easy to read.
Navigate to the project's directory, open terminal and follow the instructions below:
```
$ style50 *.py
```

```
# Example

$ style50 *.py
Results generated by style50 v2.7.5

## Deployment

How to deploy this on a live system:
Navigate to the project's directory, open terminal and follow the instructions below:
```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
```
